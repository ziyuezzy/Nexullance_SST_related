This is a repository for simulating HPC networks with SST-Toolkit.
Three sst-elements: Ember, Firefly, and Merlin are used in the setup. Please refer to the images in ./doc for better understanding what they do.

For using/reproducing, first run ./setup.sh.

Make sure you have installed the sst-core () and sst-element ()
