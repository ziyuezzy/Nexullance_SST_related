For differential Nexullance, we try to analyze the dynamic traffic demand of the SST network simulation.
When sampling at increasing freqency, would the difference between adjusent traffic demand matrices always decrease?
We also try to build-up a data set (sampled traffic demand matrices) for testing differential Nexullance algorithm
